Wasting no time, he tried it out in several self-portraits. He did this mostly to avoid having to pay for a model. Using rhythmic brushstrokes in striking colours, he portrayed himself here as a fashionably dressed Parisian.",

Les deux hommes s’étaient probablement rencontrés dans la ville de Leyde où Marten avait fait auparavant des études de droit. Son costume exubérant, garni de dentelle coûteuse et d’extravagantes rosettes à ses souliers, lui valurent au XIXe siècle le qualificatif de ‘dandy’.",

The woman’s distinctive features – a domed forehead, slightly bulging eyes, and\npronounced chin – are easily recognized in depictions of ancient goddesses and heroines that Rembrandt\npainted in the 1630s. Thus the painting is not strictly a portrait, but a ‘tronie’, or fantasy head.",

The image can be interpreted as an admonition to praise God with singing and music-making, but also as a risqué scene of seduction. The young woman’s gaudy garments and red shoes are in questionable taste, and the old woman looks suspiciously like a procuress. Perhaps the painting contains a warning against immoral conduct.",
